# Logic Apps

With Logic Apps and Microsoft Power Automate, you can take a similar approach to designing a workflow. They both include user interfaces in which you can draw out the workflow. We call this approach a design-first approach.

Logic Apps is a service within Azure that you can use to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application. By using the design-first approach in Logic Apps, you can draw out complex workflows that model complex business processes.

Alternatively, if you prefer to work in code, you can create or edit a workflow in JSON notation by using the code view.

Logic Apps provides hundreds of pre-built connectors that you can use to create your apps. If you have an unusual or unique system that you want to call from a Logic Apps, you can create your own connector if your system exposes a REST API.
