# Azure Virtual Machines

## Start with the Network

Virtual networks (VNets) are used in Azure to provide private connectivity between Azure Virtual Machines and other Azure services. VMs and services that are part of the same virtual network can access one another. By default, services outside the virtual network cannot connect to services within the virtual network.

Network addresses and subnets are not trivial to change once you have them set up, and if you plan to connect your private company network to the Azure services, you will want to make sure you consider the topology before putting any VMs into place.

## Secure the Network

By default, there is no security boundary between subnets, so services in each of these subnets can talk to one another. However, you can set up Network Security Groups (NSGs), which allow you to control the traffic flow to and from subnets and to and from VMs. NSGs act as software firewalls, applying custom rules to each inbound or outbound request at the network interface and subnet level. 

## Location of the VM

When you create and deploy a virtual machine, you must select a region where you want the resources (CPU, storage, etc.) to be allocated. This lets you place your VMs as close as possible to your users to improve performance and to meet any legal, compliance, or tax requirements.

Each region has different hardware available and some configurations are not available in all regions. Second, there are price differences between locations.

## Size of the VM

| Option | Description |
|-------|----------|
| **General purpose** | General-purpose VMs are designed to have a balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers. |
| **Compute optimized** | Compute optimized VMs are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers. |
| **Memory optimized** | Memory optimized VMs are designed to have a high memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. |
| **Storage optimized** | Storage optimized VMs are designed to have high disk throughput and IO. Ideal for VMs running databases. |
| **GPU** | GPU VMs are specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphics rendering and video editing. These VMs are ideal options for model training and inferencing with deep learning. |
| **High performance computes** | High performance compute is the fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces. |

## Pricing Model

- **Compute costs:**  You are not charged for compute capacity if you stop and deallocate the VM since this releases the hardware. For example, you are only charged for 55 minutes of usage if the VM is deployed for 55 minutes. The cost for a VM includes the charge for the Windows operating system. Linux-based instances are cheaper because there is no operating system license charge.
- **Storage costs:** You are charged separately for the storage the VM uses. The status of the VM has no relation to the storage charges that will be incurred; even if the VM is stopped/deallocated and you arenâ€™t billed for the running VM, you will be charged for the storage used by the disks.

## Storage for the VM

Best practice is that all Azure virtual machines will have at least two virtual hard disks (VHDs). The first disk stores the operating system, and the second is used as temporary storage. Also, separating out the data to different VHDs allows you to manage the security, reliability, and performance of the disk independently.

The data for each VHD is held in Azure Storage as page blobs, which allows Azure to allocate space only for the storage you use.

| Option | Description |
|-----------------|----------|
| Unmanaged disks | With unmanaged disks, you are responsible for the storage accounts that are used to hold the VHDs that correspond to your VM disks. A storage account is capable of supporting 40 standard virtual hard disks at full utilization. If you need to scale out with more disks, then you'll need more storage accounts, which can get complicated. |
| Managed disks | Solve this complexity by putting the burden of managing the storage accounts onto Azure. You specify the size of the disk, up to 4 TB, and Azure creates and manages both the disk and the storage. |

## Availability Set

An availability set is a logical feature used to ensure that a group of related VMs are deployed so that they aren't all subject to a single point of failure and not all upgraded at the same time during a host operating system upgrade in the datacenter.

### Fault Domain

A fault domain is a logical group of hardware in Azure that shares a common set of hardware components, and that share a single point of failure. You can think of it as a rack within an on-premises datacenter. The first two VMs in an availability set will be provisioned into two different racks so that if the network or the power failed in a rack, only one VM would be affected. Fault domains are also defined for managed disks attached to VMs.

### Update Domain

An update domain is a logical group of hardware that can undergo maintenance, or be rebooted at the same time. Azure will automatically place availability sets into update domains to minimize the impact when the Azure platform introduces host operating system changes. Azure then processes each update domain one at a time.

## Failover across locations

You can also replicate your infrastructure across sites to handle regional failover. Azure Site Recovery replicates workloads from a primary site to a secondary location. If an outage happens at your primary site, you can fail over to a secondary location. This failover enables users to continue to access your applications without interruption. You can then fail back to the primary location after it's up and running again. Azure Site Recovery is about replication of virtual or physical machines;
