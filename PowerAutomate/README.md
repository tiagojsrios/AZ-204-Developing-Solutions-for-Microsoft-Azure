# Microsoft Power Automate

Microsoft Power Automate is a service that you can use to create workflows even when you have no development or IT Pro experience. You can create workflows that integrate and orchestrate many different components by using the website or the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app.

- **Automated:** A flow that is started by a trigger from some event. For example, the event could be the arrival of a new tweet or a new file being uploaded.

- **Button:** Use a button flow to run a repetitive task with a single click from your mobile device.

- **Scheduled:** A flow that executes on a regular basis such as once a week, on a specific date, or after 10 hours.

- **Business process:** A flow that models a business process such as the stock ordering process or the complaints procedure. The flow process can have: notification to required people; with their approval recorded; calendar dates for steps; and recorded time of flow steps.
