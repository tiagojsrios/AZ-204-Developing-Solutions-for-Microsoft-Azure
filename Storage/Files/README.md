# Azure Files

Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be accessed using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 

You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries. You can also associate a unique URL to any file to allow fine-grained access to a private file for a set period of time. File shares can be used for many common scenarios:

- Storing shared configuration files for VMs, tools, or utilities so that everyone is using the same version.

- Log files such as diagnostics, metrics, and crash dumps.

- Shared data between on-premises applications and Azure VMs to allow migration of apps to the cloud over a period of time.
