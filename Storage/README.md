| Term | Explanation |
|------|------|
| Durable | Redundancy ensures that your data is safe in the event of transient hardware failures. You can also replicate data across datacenters or geographical regions for extra protection from local catastrophe or natural disaster. Data replicated in this way remains highly available in the event of an unexpected outage. |
| Secure | All data written to Azure Storage is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data. |
| Scalable | Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications. |
| Managed | Microsoft Azure handles maintenance and any critical problems for you. |
