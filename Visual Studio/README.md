## Visual Studio workloads for ASP.NET Core development and publishing
Visual Studio 2019 has two workloads that you need to create, publish, and deploy your website to Azure. These workloads include the templates for your ASP.NET Core site and provides the ability to connect and deploy your site to Azure.

- **ASP.NET and web development:** The web development workload in Visual Studio is designed to maximize your productivity in developing web applications using ASP.NET and standards-based technologies like HTML and JavaScript.

- **Azure development:** The Azure development workload in Visual Studio installs the latest Azure SDK for .NET and tools for Visual Studio. Once these items are installed, you can view resources in Cloud Explorer, create resources using Azure Resource Manager tools, build applications for Azure web and Cloud Services, and perform big data operations using Azure Data Lake tools.
