# Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center (ASC) is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all of your services both in Azure, and on-premises.

- Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
- Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
- Continuously monitor all your services and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
- Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed in your services and virtual machines. You can also allowlist applications to ensure that only the apps you validate are allowed to execute.
- Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help to investigate threats and any post-breach activity which might have occurred.
- Just-In-Time access control for ports, reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic you require.
