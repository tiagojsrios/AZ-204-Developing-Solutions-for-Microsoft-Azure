# Messages

- A message contains raw data, produced by one component, that will be consumed by another component.
- A message contains the data itself, not just a reference to that data.
- The sending component expects the message content to be processed in a certain way by the destination component. The integrity of the overall system may depend on both sender and receiver doing a specific job.

# Events

Events are lighter weight than messages, and are most often used for broadcast communications. The components sending the event are known as publishers, and receivers are known as subscribers.

- An event is a lightweight notification that indicates that something happened.
- The event may be sent to multiple receivers, or to none at all.
- Events are often intended to "fan out," or have a large number of subscribers for each publisher.
- The publisher of the event has no expectation about the action a receiving component takes.
- Some events are discrete units and unrelated to other events.
- Some events are part of a related and ordered series.
