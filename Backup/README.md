# Azure Backup

Azure Backup is a backup as a service offering that protects physical or virtual machines no matter where they reside: on-premises or in the cloud.

- **Automatic storage management:** Azure Backup automatically allocates and manages backup storage and uses a pay-as-you-use model. You only pay for what you use.

- **Unlimited scaling:** Azure Backup uses the power and scalability of Azure to deliver high availability.

- **Multiple storage options:** Azure Backup offers locally redundant storage where all copies of the data exist within the same region and geo-redundant storage where your data is replicated to a secondary region.

- **Unlimited data transfer:** Azure Backup does not limit the amount of inbound or outbound data you transfer. Azure Backup also does not charge for the data that is transferred.

- **Data encryption:** Data encryption allows for secure transmission and storage of your data in Azure.

- **Application-consistent backup:** An application-consistent backup means that a recovery point has all required data to restore the backup copy. Azure Backup provides application-consistent backups.

- **Long-term retention:** Azure doesn't limit the length of time you keep the backup data.
